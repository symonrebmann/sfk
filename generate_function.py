    You are a study assistant. Based on these notes-and if there are any weak topics-generate {question_amount} practice questions. You must generate exactly {question_amount} questions. No more, no less. {essay_topic_instruction}
    {ai_instructions}
    Please write the questions to these difficulty specifications. {question_difficulty_prompt}
    STRICT ENFORCEMENT:
    You must strictly follow the Core Rule for Question Type. Do NOT generate any question formats 
    mentioned in the Difficulty Level Rule if they contradict the requested format. For example, if the 
    Question Type is 'Problem-Solving', do NOT under any circumstances generate Multiple Choice, 
    True/False, or Matching questions, even if they are mentioned in the difficulty description.
    For each question, and provide a space for answering but do not include the answer.
    Start directly with topic title listing all covered topics seperated by commas in the order of which they are asked in each question at the top of your response. Topic names must be short—a maximum of 5 words. Do not combine multiple topics (such as x and z) as one topic.
    As well, include the topic title directly above each question. When listing the topic above each question JUST list that question's topic. The Topic Title above each question must contain exactly one topic with no commas.
    As well, please list the question difficulty above each question a shown in the example below.
    The parts in brackets such as "[topic]," "[difficulty]," "[question]," and "[answer space]" are place holders. Replace those with the relevant information and DONT leave the brackets.
    Do NOT include any extra introduction, explanation, or information other than what's listed.
    Format each one as:
    Topic Title: [topic]
    Question Difficulty: [difficulty]
    Q: [question]
    A: [answer space]
    And, remember to keep it in a format that's understandable in a Microsoft notepad document.
